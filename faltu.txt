In the field $F_{3^2} = F_3[x]/(2x^2 + x + 1)$, let $\alpha$ be the root and primitive element. 

The elements of $F_{3^2}$ can be represented in 2 ways:  
1. As polynomials ($degree <= 1$) in $\alpha$ with coefficients in $F_3$
2. As 0, 1, $\alpha$, $\alpha^2$, ... $\alpha^{3^2 - 2}$.

And the 2 ways can be related by using the fact that $2\alpha^2 + \alpha + 1 = 0$ in $F_3[\alpha]$.

But that is true only in $F_3[\alpha]$ ?

For eg. I know $\alpha^5 = 2\alpha$ in $F_3[\alpha]$
